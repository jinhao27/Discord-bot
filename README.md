# Discord-bot
This is the source code for a discord bot I programmed for a discord channel my Junior Achievement company is using. It has a variety of commands and works in conjunction with other discord bots to maintain the server. Together, the bots have moderation, auto roll assigning, compliments, embeds, various messages (rules, welcome message, announcements, etc.), and suggestions. 

## Motivation
My Junior Achievement company needed a way to manage our discord server, whether it be moderation, sending announcements, engaging with users, setting rules, and setting roles. A discord bot programmed from scratch that could be customized specifically to cater towards these needs was exactly what we needed, and that's what this is :)
