# Discord-bot
This is the source code for a discord bot I programmed for a discord channel my Junior Achievement company is using. It has a variety of commands and works in conjunction with other discord bots to maintain the server. Together, the bots have moderation, auto roll assigning, compliments, embeds, various messages (rules, welcome message, announcements, etc.), and suggestions. The Stacked Announcer bot runs on JavaScript code using node.js and discord.js. Discord.js allows a lot of freedom in customizing a discord bot to your own liking, and that's exactly what I've done here. Enjoy! :)
